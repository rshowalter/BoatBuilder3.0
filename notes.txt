1. Client requests the leaderboard from the server
2. Server responds with the leaderboard in JSON form
3. Python takes the json and turns it into the data to be printed out to the screen
4. Under certain conditions like exit, the data will be sent to the server and put on the leaderboard...

Questiosn:

How will the data be stored on the server? PHP code to process the data? Python backend?

Thoughts:
Seperate files for leaderboard and differet request for putting in the data into the leaderboard... this also has to be secure...
